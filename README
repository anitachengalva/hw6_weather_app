# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project is a weather application that runs in browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Weather information displayed is dependant on user input for location, and pulls weather data from he third-party serverside API [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api). Any persistent data is stored in `localStorage`.  

The application features a location searchbar as well as a 5-day forecast, temperature, wind, and humidity for the user's city input.
